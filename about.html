            <p>Kyuri Jo is a postdoctoral fellow at Bio and Health Informatics Lab. She received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University. She has focused on <b>analyzing time-series with machine learning techniques</b> since she joined the lab in 2013. Her first approach to analyze biological pathway (network) with time series gene expression data successfully elucidated different mechanism of drought-resistant rice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.02.001" target="_blank">Methods, 2014</a>). She expanded her work to consider regulators of the dynamic network and the paper was accepted at the top conference and journal (ISMB 2016; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw275" target="_blank">Bioinformatics, 2016</a>) in the fields of Bioinformatics. She has been involved in several biological research projects such as xenotransplantation and obesity researches to apply her algorithms for more effective and accurate follow-up studies.</p>
            <p>Jo’s recent honors include Naver Ph.D. fellowship in 2017 for her research performance in the field of computer science and ISMB travel fellowship from ISMB 2016 for her Bioinformatics paper.</p>
